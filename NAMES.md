# Names

Names have been a powerful identity anchor for me, especially as a trans person. 

I go into more detail about this [on my website](https://pigeon.dev/pages/names).

> **Note**:
> - Aliases were sometimes used in highly-visible roles to preserve _some_ privacy.
> - Sometimes other surnames were used for similar reasons.
> - Birth name is scrambled to increase the difficulty for crawlers and SEO.
