## Hihiâ€”Iâ€™m Willow ğŸ‘‹

But you may know me as Kara Finch.

- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m a 26-year-old trans, queer ~~pigeon~~ woman.
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m a multidisciplinary software engineer with a focus on infrastructure and distributed systems.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Kubernetes and observability.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've found myself back in Vancouver after years of living in various places but primarily MontrÃ©al and Berlin.
